# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via an issue,
an email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Making a Pull Request
When you're ready to contribute:

1. Ensure any installed or built dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   Pull Request. Ensure also that your code is clean and production ready.
2. Update the [README.md](./README.md) with details of changes to the module, including variables, outputs
   or changes to [examples](./examples).
3. Update the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) with a new entry block starting with `# Unreleased`
   followed by a description of your new feature, bug fix or change.
4. The Github Actions CI must pass. It ensures that our Terraform module codestyle rules are followed.
5. Please wait for maintainers to review your code, they will merge and release your changes once every
   discussions or implementation details are satisfied.

### Pre-commit usage

We recommend using `pre-commit` [the famous python git hooks tool](https://pre-commit.com/#intro))
when you start a contribution. It will automatically trigger hooks which ensure our codestyle rules are followed,
files are formatted and linted, and that your README.md file is proprerly generated and updated.

To maintain a clean, consistent, and secure codebase, we use pre-commit (`pre-commit`(https://pre-commit.com/#intro)) â€” a powerful framework that automatically runs formatting, validation, and security checks before each commit.
By installing and enabling it, you ensure that:
- Your code respects our formatting and style conventions
- README.md and Terraform documentation are always up-to-date
- Common errors are caught early (e.g., trailing whitespace, insecure code, etc.)

Installation
We recommend using pipx for isolated tool installs:
```bash
pipx install pre-commit
```
Or, using standard Python tooling:
```bash
pip3 install pre-commit --user
```

Enabling hooks in your local repo
From the root of your cloned module:
```bash
cd path/to/module/
pre-commit install
```
This command sets up pre-commit to run automatically every time you commit changes.

First-time usage
To manually trigger all hooks on your codebase and clean it up:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
This is especially useful before your first commit or pull request.

To ensure all `pre-commit` hooks run correctly, make sure the following dependencies are installed locally:
- The latest version of (`Terraform`[https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/])
- (`terraform-docs`[https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs]) for generating module documentation
- (`tflint`[https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint]) for Terraform linting and static analysis
- (`tfsec`[https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec]) for security scanning of Terraform code
:wq
ðŸ’¡ These tools are used by various hooks to validate code, enforce standards, and improve security â€” installing them ensures `pre-commit` works as expected.
